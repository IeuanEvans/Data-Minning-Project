This research project uses publicly available data from https://www.procyclingstats.com/ and machine learning to predicted professional road cycling results. There are sereral deciplins within professional road cycling is very unsually sport. For example, within a singling stage of the Tour de France motives they could some riders might sprinting to be the first rider across a checkpoint miles before the actual finish line, whilts other riders will be focused on conserving    
may have different incentives such as intermediate sprints 

Professional road cycling has two main compitition formats; one-day races and stage races. Stage races or "tours" take multiple days, and consist of several mass-start races and time-trials called stages. However, this project is only concerned with predicting the results of one-day races. The most prestidigous one-day races are the five 'momuments of cycling' they are Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège and Giro di Lombardia. 


Step One: Data Mining/Web Scraping

I needed a way of extracting data off ProCyclingStats.com and storing it in a format ready for analysis. To learn how to achieve this on Corey Schafer's YouTube channel, he has a tuturial on webscrape using BeuatifulSoup and Requests libraries.
