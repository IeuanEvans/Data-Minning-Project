Professional Cycling Outcome Prediction Project 
======================

### This research project uses publicly available data from https://www.procyclingstats.com/ 

## Step One: Data Mining/Web Scraping

As this was my first project on this kind I needed to find an effective way of extracting data off ProCyclingStats.com and storing it in a format ready for analysis. I highly rate Corey Schafer's YouTube channel for learning Python, fortunetly he had made video tuturial on webscrape using BeuatifulSoup and Requests libraries, which I used along with BeuatifulSoup library documentation by crummy.com.

With the help of the resources mentioned above wrote a script goes through each race result and rider profile page that writes the relavent statistics (e.g. date, distance, average speed, top-10 wins etc.) to pandas dataframes.

## Step Two: Data Cleaning and Processing 

Some of the data contains unwanted characters other data in missing completly.
