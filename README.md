Determining which algorithm to use: this answer depends on many factors such as the problem statement, dedsired output , type and size of the data, the available computational time, number of features, and observations in the data.



1. Size of the training data:

If the training data is smaller and a higher number of features choose algorithms with high bias/low variance like Linear regression, Naïve Bayes, or Linear SVM
If the training data is sufficiently large and the number of observations is higher as compared to the number of features, one can go for low bias/high variance algorithms like KNN, Decision trees, or kernel SVM.


2. The output Trade off Accuracy between Interpretability: 

If inference is the goal (interpretability), then restrictive models (linear regression, least squares) are better as they are much more interpretable (High bias/under fitting) 
Flexible models are better if higher accuracy is the goal. (low bias/over fitting/high variance)

3. Speed or Training time

Higher accuracy typically means higher training time. Also, algorithms require more time to train on large training data. Algorithms like Naïve Bayes and Linear and Logistic regression are easy to implement and quick to run. Algorithms like SVM, which involve tuning of parameters, Neural networks with high convergence time, and random forests, need a lot of time to train the data.

I have never bet on sports 

I thought that if I can design an algorithm that slightly more accuracy than the bookmakers, I could spread the risk by betting on multiple races/riders, thus making reliable revenue.

My goal in my for this projet is to improvement my data science skills and to learn more about professional cycling.
