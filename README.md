This research project uses publicly available data from https://www.procyclingstats.com/ and machine learning to predicted professional road cycling results. There are sereral deciplins within professional road cycling is very unsually sport. For example, within a singling stage of the Tour de France motives they could some riders might sprinting to be the first rider across a checkpoint miles before the actual finish line, whilts other riders will be focused on conserving    
may have different incentives such as intermediate sprints 


This project is concerned only with predicting the results of one-day races. This race format is argualby the simplist to analysis becuase gerneally speaking everyrider  

Professional road cycling has two main compitition formats; one-day races and stage races. Stage races or "tours" take multiple days, and consist of several mass-start races and time-trials called stages. The most prestidigous one-day races are the five 'momuments of cycling' they are Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège and Giro di Lombardia. The three most prestidgous stage races are; the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and  Vuelta a España.

Chapter One: Data Mining/Web Scraping

I needed a way of extracting data off ProCyclingStats.com and storing it on my computer in a format ready for analysis. One of the first places I looked was Corey Schafer's YouTube channel, sure enough he had made a tuturial video on how to webscrape using BeuatifulSoup and Requests.  

 
Chapter Two: Feature engineering 



The  distance, race surfaces, weather. A flat route will favour more explosive althletes, the statergy for these rider types will be  by stucking behind other rider which shields them from the wind to conseve energy.

This project is concerned only with predicting the result outcomes of one-day races. Predicting Stage races may be
