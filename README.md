This research project uses publicly available data and machine learning to forecast professional road cycling results. 


There are two disinct compitions formats within the sport of professional road cycling, these are the one-day races and stage races races. Stage races or "tours" take multiple days, and consist of several mass-start races and time-trials called stages. The most prestidgous stage races are the grand tours they are Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and  Vuelta a España. The most prestidigous one-day races are the five 'momuments of cycling' they are Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège and Giro di Lombardia.

I have never bet on sports 

I thought that if I can design an algorithm that slightly more accuracy than the bookmakers, I could spread the risk by betting on multiple races/riders, thus making reliable revenue.

My goal in my for this projet is to improvement my data science skills and to learn more about professional cycling.
